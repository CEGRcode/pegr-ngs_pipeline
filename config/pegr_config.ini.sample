# Due to the way bcl2fastq compresses files (it does not include an end of file block),
# this enhancement was added manually to the ~/src/FastQValidator.cpp file:
# https://github.com/statgen/fastQValidator/commit/0b7decb8b502cd8d9d6bf27dbd9e319ed8478b53.
# The package was then compiled normally.

# 3) Invoke a workflow that does not include blacklist filtering

# contains a single dataset, the "single" workflow will be selected, while
# the "paired" workflow will be selected if the folder contains 2 datasets.

[len_files]

# This sections contains the full path to the Galaxy len file for each dbkey.

# updating the dbkey parameter settings for tools in the workflow being invoked.
# PEGR should be handling this in the future.
